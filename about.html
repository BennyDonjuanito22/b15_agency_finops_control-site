        <span class="badge">Our Story</span>
        <h1>Built by operators, <span>for operators</span></h1>
        <p class="lead">FinOpsControl was born from the frustration of managing finances across spreadsheets, bank portals, and accounting tools that weren't built for service businesses. We set out to build the financial command center we always wanted.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Mission -->
      <section class="section">
        <div class="split">
          <div>
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p class="muted" style="margin-top:1rem;">Every agency founder, freelancer, and service business owner deserves real-time visibility into their financial health — without needing a CFO on payroll or an accounting degree. FinOpsControl exists to democratize financial operations.</p>
            <p class="muted" style="margin-top:1rem;">We believe that when business owners can see exactly where their money is going, how much each client actually costs, and what their cash position will look like next month, they make better decisions. Better decisions mean healthier businesses, more jobs, and more value delivered to the world.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Our Values</h2>
            <div class="card" style="margin-top:1rem;">
              <h3>Transparency First</h3>
              <p>We build tools that surface truth — no hidden fees, no vanity metrics, no misleading dashboards. If the numbers are bad, you'll know immediately.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card" style="margin-top:1rem;">
              <h3>Security is Non-Negotiable</h3>
              <p>Financial data is sacred. We encrypt everything at rest and in transit, pursue SOC 2 compliance, and never sell or share your data with third parties.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card" style="margin-top:1rem;">
              <h3>Operator Empathy</h3>
              <p>Our team has run agencies and freelance businesses. We build the features we need ourselves, and we prioritize the workflows that matter most to operators.</p>
