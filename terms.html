          <p class="legal-date">Effective Date: January 1, 2026 · Last Updated: February 1, 2026</p>

          <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the FinOpsControl platform, website, and related services (collectively, the "Service") operated by FinOpsControl ("we," "us," or "our"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

          <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
          <p>By creating an account, accessing, or using the Service, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. If you are using the Service on behalf of a business or organization, you represent that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms.</p>

          <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
          <p>FinOpsControl provides a cloud-based financial operations dashboard designed for agencies, freelancers, and service businesses.

You must notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.</p>

          <h2>4. Subscription Plans &amp; Billing</h2>
          <p>The Service is offered under subscription plans (Solo, Agency, Enterprise) as described on our <a href="products.html">Plans page</a>. Subscriptions are billed monthly or annually in advance. All fees are stated in US dollars and are non-refundable except as required by applicable law or as otherwise stated in these Terms.</p>

          <h2>6. Cancellation &amp; Refunds</h2>
          <p>You may cancel your subscription at any time from your account settings. Cancellation takes effect at the end of your current billing period.

          <h2>10. Intellectual Property</h2>
          <p>The Service, including its software, design, text, graphics, logos, and trademarks, is the property of FinOpsControl and is protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. These Terms do not grant you any rights to use our trademarks, logos, or branding without our prior written consent.</p>

          <h2>11. Third-Party Integrations</h2>
          <p>The Service may integrate with third-party services (e.g., bank feeds via Plaid, accounting software, payment processors). Your use of third-party services is subject to their respective terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for the availability, accuracy, or conduct of third-party services.</p>

          <h2>12. Service Availability &amp; SLA</h2>
          <p>We target 99.95% uptime for the Service. However, we do not guarantee uninterrupted access. The Service may be temporarily unavailable due to maintenance, updates, or circumstances beyond our control. Scheduled maintenance will be communicated in advance when possible.</p>

          <h2>13. Limitation of Liability</h2>
          <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, FinOpsControl shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, revenue, data, or business opportunities, arising from your use of or inability to use the Service. Our total liability shall not exceed the fees paid by you in the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.</p>

          <h2>14. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
          <p>The Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. FinOpsControl does not warrant that the Service will be error-free, secure, or available at all times.</p>

          <p>We reserve the right to update or modify these Terms at any time. Material changes will be communicated via email or through a notice on the Service at least 30 days before they take effect. Your continued use of the Service after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

          <h2>17. Governing Law &amp; Dispute Resolution</h2>
          <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any disputes arising from these Terms or the Service shall be resolved through binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association, except that either party may seek injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

          <h2>18. Severability</h2>
          <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, and the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
