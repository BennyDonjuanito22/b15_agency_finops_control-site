          <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
          <p class="legal-date">Effective Date: January 1, 2026 · Last Updated: February 1, 2026</p>

          <p>FinOpsControl ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting the privacy and security of your personal and financial data. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, store, share, and protect information when you use the FinOpsControl platform, website, and related services (the "Service"). Because FinOpsControl is a financial operations tool that processes sensitive financial data, we hold ourselves to the highest standards of data protection.</p>

          <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

          <h3>1.1 Account Information</h3>
          <p>When you create an account, we collect your name, email address, business name, phone number (optional), and billing information (credit card or ACH details processed via our PCI-compliant payment processor).</p>

          <h3>1.2 Financial Data via Bank Feed Integration</h3>
          <p>When you connect bank accounts, credit cards, or payment processors through our integration partner (Plaid), we receive transaction data including transaction amounts, dates, merchant names, and account balances. <strong>We only establish read-only connections</strong> — we cannot initiate transactions, transfers, or payments from your accounts. Bank login credentials are never stored on our servers; they are handled entirely by our integration partner.</p>

          <h3>1.3 Expense &amp; Financial Operations Data</h3>
          <p>As you use the Service, we store the financial data you create and manage, including expense categorizations, client records, contractor information (names, payment amounts, tax IDs for 1099 preparation), project data, profit and loss reports, and cash flow forecasts.</p>

          <h3>1.4 Usage Data</h3>
          <p>We automatically collect technical data such as IP address, browser type, device information, pages visited, features used, and session duration. This data helps us improve the Service and troubleshoot issues.</p>

          <h3>1.5 Cookies &amp; Tracking</h3>
          <p>We use cookies and similar technologies for authentication, preferences, and analytics. See Section 8 for details on cookies and your choices.</p>

          <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
          <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the Service, including real-time P&amp;L dashboards, cash flow forecasting, and financial reporting.</li>
            <li>Process transactions and manage your subscription billing.</li>
            <li>Import and categorize your financial transactions via bank feed integrations.</li>
            <li>Generate contractor tracking reports and 1099 preparation documents.</li>
            <li>Send you service-related communications (billing receipts, feature updates, security alerts).</li>
            <li>Provide customer support and respond to your inquiries.</li>
            <li>Analyze usage patterns to improve performance, usability, and feature prioritization.</li>
            <li>Detect and prevent fraud, abuse, and security threats.</li>
            <li>Comply with legal obligations, including tax reporting and regulatory requirements.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>3. Financial Data Protection</h2>
          <p>Given the sensitive nature of financial operations data, we implement multiple layers of protection:</p>

          <h3>3.1 Encryption at Rest</h3>
          <p>All financial data stored in our databases is encrypted using <strong>256-bit AES encryption</strong>. Encryption keys are managed through a dedicated key management service (KMS) with automatic key rotation. Database backups are also fully encrypted.</p>

          <h3>3.2 Encryption in Transit</h3>
          <p>All data transmitted between your browser and our servers uses <strong>TLS 1.3</strong> encryption. API communications are encrypted end-to-end. We enforce HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) to prevent downgrade attacks.</p>

          <h3>3.3 Bank Feed Security</h3>
          <p>Bank feed connections are established through Plaid, a leading financial data aggregation platform. Your bank login credentials are never transmitted to or stored on FinOpsControl servers. Plaid handles authentication directly with your financial institution. We receive only read-only transaction data via encrypted API calls.</p>

          <h3>3.4 SOC 2 Compliance</h3>
          <p>FinOpsControl has completed a <strong>SOC 2 Type I</strong> audit and is actively pursuing <strong>SOC 2 Type II</strong> certification. Our controls cover security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. SOC 2 reports are available to Enterprise customers under NDA upon request.</p>

          <h3>3.5 Infrastructure Security</h3>
          <p>Our Service runs on SOC 2-certified cloud infrastructure with:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Isolated virtual private clouds (VPCs) with strict network segmentation.</li>
            <li>Web application firewall (WAF) protection against common attack vectors.</li>
            <li>Continuous vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.</li>
            <li>Multi-region data replication for disaster recovery.</li>
            <li>Automated intrusion detection and alerting systems.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>3.6 Access Controls</h3>
          <p>Internal access to customer financial data is restricted on a need-to-know basis. All access is logged and audited. Employees with access undergo background checks and security training. Enterprise customers benefit from role-based access controls (RBAC) and single sign-on (SSO) integration.</p>

          <h2>4. Data Sharing &amp; Disclosure</h2>
          <p><strong>We do not sell your personal or financial data to third parties. Ever.</strong></p>
          <p>We may share your information only in the following limited circumstances:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We share data with trusted third-party service providers who assist us in operating the Service (e.g., Plaid for bank feeds, Stripe for payment processing, cloud hosting providers). These providers are contractually obligated to protect your data and may only use it to perform services on our behalf.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law, subpoena, court order, or government regulation, or if we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, your safety, or the safety of others.</li>
            <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your data may be transferred to the acquiring entity. We will notify you of any such transfer and any changes to this Privacy Policy.</li>
            <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We may share data with third parties when you explicitly authorize us to do so (e.g., exporting data to QuickBooks or Xero).</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
          <p>We retain your account and financial data for as long as your account is active. After account cancellation, we retain your data for 90 days to allow for reactivation or export. After the 90-day retention period, all data is permanently and securely deleted from our systems and backups.</p>
          <p>Certain data may be retained longer if required by law (e.g., billing records for tax compliance) or if necessary to resolve disputes or enforce our agreements.</p>

          <h2>6. Your Rights &amp; Choices</h2>
          <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the following rights regarding your data:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Access:</strong> Request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.</li>
            <li><strong>Correction:</strong> Request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data.</li>
            <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Request deletion of your personal data, subject to legal retention requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Export your data in standard machine-readable formats (CSV, JSON, Excel).</li>
            <li><strong>Restriction:</strong> Request that we restrict processing of your data in certain circumstances.</li>
            <li><strong>Objection:</strong> Object to processing of your data for specific purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Withdraw Consent:</strong> Where processing is based on consent, you may withdraw consent at any time.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>To exercise any of these rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@finopscontrol.com">support@finopscontrol.com</a>. We will respond within 30 days.</p>

          <h2>7. Contractor &amp; 1099 Data</h2>
          <p>If you use FinOpsControl to track contractor payments and prepare 1099 forms, you may store contractor names, addresses, tax identification numbers (TINs/SSNs), and payment amounts. This data is treated with the highest level of sensitivity:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Contractor TINs/SSNs are encrypted at rest using dedicated encryption keys separate from other data.</li>
            <li>Access to contractor tax data is restricted to authorized account users only.</li>
            <li>1099 data exports are delivered via encrypted channels.</li>
            <li>You are responsible for ensuring that you have proper authorization to collect and store contractor tax information.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>8. Cookies</h2>
          <p>We use the following types of cookies:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Essential Cookies:</strong> Required for authentication, security, and core functionality. Cannot be disabled.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics Cookies:</strong> Help us understand how users interact with the Service (e.g., page views, feature usage). Used to improve the product.</li>
            <li><strong>Preference Cookies:</strong> Remember your settings and preferences (e.g., dashboard layout, timezone).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You can manage cookie preferences through your browser settings. Note that disabling essential cookies may prevent you from using the Service.</p>

          <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
          <p>The Service is not intended for individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we learn that we have collected data from a child under 18, we will delete it promptly.</p>

          <h2>10. International Data Transfers</h2>
          <p>FinOpsControl is based in the United States. If you access the Service from outside the US, your data may be transferred to and processed in the United States. We implement appropriate safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses) to protect data transferred internationally in compliance with applicable data protection laws, including GDPR.</p>

          <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
          <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Material changes will be communicated via email or through a prominent notice on the Service at least 30 days before they take effect. Your continued use of the Service after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.</p>
